# Bergamot Translator

Bergamot translator provides a unified API for ([Marian NMT](https://marian-nmt.github.io/) framework based) neural machine translation functionality in accordance with the [Bergamot](https://browser.mt/) project that focuses on improving client-side machine translation in a web browser.

## Build Instructions

### Build Natively
1. Clone the repository using these instructions:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator
    cd bergamot-translator
    ```
2. Compile

    Create a folder where you want to build all the artifacts (`build-native` in this case) and compile in that folder
    ```bash
    mkdir build-native
    cd build-native
    cmake ../
    make -j
    ```

### Build WASM
#### Compiling for the first time

1. Download and Install Emscripten using following instructions
    * Get the latest sdk: `git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git`
    * Enter the cloned directory: `cd emsdk`
    * Install the lastest sdk tools: `./emsdk install latest`
    * Activate the latest sdk tools: `./emsdk activate latest`
    * Activate path variables: `source ./emsdk_env.sh`

2. Clone the repository using these instructions:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator
    cd bergamot-translator
    ```

3. Download files (only required if you want to package files in wasm binary)

    This step is only required if you want to package files (e.g. models, vocabularies etc.)
    into wasm binary. If you don't then just skip this step.

    The build preloads the files in Emscriptenâ€™s virtual file system.

    If you want to package bergamot project specific models, please follow these instructions:
    ```bash
    mkdir models
    git clone --depth 1 --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/mozilla-applied-ml/bergamot-models
    cp -rf bergamot-models/prod/* models
    gunzip models/*/*
    ```

4. Compile
    1. Create a folder where you want to build all the artefacts (`build-wasm` in this case)
        ```bash
        mkdir build-wasm
        cd build-wasm
        ```

    2. Compile the artefacts
        * If you want to package files into wasm binary then execute following commands (Replace `FILES_TO_PACKAGE` with the path of the
        directory containing the files to be packaged in wasm binary)

            ```bash
            emcmake cmake -DCOMPILE_WASM=on -DPACKAGE_DIR=FILES_TO_PACKAGE ../
            emmake make -j
            ```
            e.g. If you want to package bergamot project specific models (downloaded using step 3 above) then
            replace `FILES_TO_PACKAGE` with `../models`

        * If you don't want to package any file into wasm binary then execute following commands:
            ```bash
            emcmake cmake -DCOMPILE_WASM=on ../
            emmake make -j
            ```

    3. Enable SIMD Wormhole via Wasm instantiation API in generated artifacts
        ```
        sed -i.bak 's/var result = WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response, info);/var result = WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response, info, {simdWormhole:true});/g' wasm/bergamot-translator-worker.js
        sed -i.bak 's/return WebAssembly.instantiate(binary, info);/return WebAssembly.instantiate(binary, info, {simdWormhole:true});/g' wasm/bergamot-translator-worker.js
        sed -i.bak 's/var module = new WebAssembly.Module(bytes);/var module = new WebAssembly.Module(bytes, {simdWormhole:true});/g' wasm/bergamot-translator-worker.js
        ```
    The artefacts (.js and .wasm files) will be available in `wasm` folder of build directory ("build-wasm" in this case).

#### Recompiling
As long as you don't update any submodule, just follow steps in `4.ii` to recompile.\
If you update a submodule, execute following command before executing steps in `4.ii` to recompile.
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```


## How to use

### Using Native version

The builds generate library that can be integrated to any project. All the public header files are specified in `src` folder.\
A short example of how to use the APIs is provided in `app/main.cpp` file.

### Using WASM version

Please follow the `README` inside the `wasm` folder of this repository that demonstrates how to use the translator in JavaScript.
