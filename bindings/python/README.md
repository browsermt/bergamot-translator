# bergamot-translator

The [Bergamot project](https://browser.mt/) adds and improves client-side
machine translation in a web browser.

This package provides Python bindings to bergamot-translator developed as part
of the Bergamot Project and extras assorted in a package to enable further use
of the library developed for local-translation on the consumer machine.

Bergamot is a consortium coordinated by the University of Edinburgh with
partners Charles University in Prague, the University of Sheffield, University
of Tartu, and Mozilla.
