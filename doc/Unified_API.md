# Unified (C++) API of Bergamot Translator

Each text entry can either be a word, a phrase, a sentence or a list of sentences and should contain plain text (without any markups or emojis). Additional information related to the translated text can be requested via TranslationRequest which is applied equally to each text entry. The translated text corresponding to each text entry and the additional information (as specified in the TranslationRequest) is encapsulated and returned in TranslationResult.
	The API splits each text entry into sentences internally, which are then translated independent of each other. The translated sentences are then joined together and returned in TranslationResult.
	Please refer to the TranslationRequest class to find out what additional information can be requested. The alignment information can only be requested if the model supports it (check isAlignmentSupported() API).
