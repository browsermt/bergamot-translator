This document describes python bindings from bergamot-translator and a
batteries included python package supplied for easy use. The library also
provides entry point via a command-line making it easier for the average user
to get started.

As bergamot-translator is built on top of marian, the python API should also
work as python bindings for marian trained models, if they need to be
integrated into python code-bases.

*Disclaimer*: The package is still in early stages and unstable. Functions and
classes might move around quite fast. Use at your own risk.
