   * Each text entry can either be a word, a phrase, a sentence or a list of
   * sentences. Additional information related to the translated text can be
   * requested via TranslationRequest which is applied equally to each text
   * entry. The translated text corresponding to each text entry and the
   * additional information (as specified in the TranslationRequest) is
   * encapsulated and returned in TranslationResult.
   *
   * The API splits each text entry into sentences internally, which are then
   * translated independent of each other. The translated sentences are then
   * joined back together and returned in TranslationResult.

   * Please refer to the TranslationRequest class to find out what additional
   * information can be requested. The alignment information can only be

   * entry of texts list will be moved to its corresponding TranslationResult
   * object).
