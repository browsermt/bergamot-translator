	 * from 1 source language to 1 target language.
	 *
	 * Each text entry can either be a word, a phrase, a sentence or a list of sentences. Additional
	 * information related to the translated text can be requested via TranslationRequest which is
	 * applied equally to each text entry. The translated text corresponding to each text entry and
	 * the additional information (as specified in the TranslationRequest) is encapsulated and
	 * returned in TranslationResult.
	 *
	 * The API splits each text entry into sentences internally, which are then translated
	 * independent of each other. The translated sentences are then joined back together and returned
	 * in TranslationResult.
	 *
	 * Please refer to the TranslationRequest class to find out what additional information can be
	 * requested. The alignment information can only be requested if the model supports it (check
	 * isAlignmentSupported() API).
	 *
	 * The texts argument will become empty after the execution of this API (each entry of texts list
	 * will be moved to its corresponding TranslationResult object).
