/// ThreadSafeL4Cache is an adapter built on top of L4 specialized for the use-case of bergamot-translator. L4 is a
/// thread-safe cache implementation written in the "lock-free" paradigm using atomic constucts. There is locking when
/// structures are deleted, which runs in the background using an epoch based memory reclamation (EBR) scheme. Eviction
/// follows the "Clock" algorithm, which is a practical approximation for LRU. Records live either until they're used at
/// least once, or if there is no space left without removing one that's not been used yet, with removal triggered to
/// make space for new insertions.
///
/// This implementation creates one additional thread which manages the garbage collection for the class.  While it may
/// be possible to get this class to compile in WASM architecture, the additional thread makes using this class
/// unsuitable for WASM's current blocking workflow.
///
/// Keys are marian::Words, values are ProcessedRequestSentences.
///
/// There is a serialization (converting to binary (data*, size)) of structs overhead with this class as well, which
/// helps keep tight lid on memory usage. This should however be cheaper in comparison to recomputing through the graph.
