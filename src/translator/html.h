/// HTML class parses and removes HTML from input text, and places it back into
/// the translated output text.
///
/// When parsing the HTML, it treats tags as markup, where a list of nested tags
/// can be seen as a list of markups that are applicable to all the text that
/// follows. This list is stored as a `TagStack`. Whenever an HTML tag opens or
/// closes, a new TagStack is created to reflect that. TagStack used to be
/// called `Taint` because it *tainted* the text it was associated with with
/// those tags as markup. The text between tags themselves is stored in the
/// input variable. In `spans_`, the TagStack that is associated with a
/// substring of that text is stored.
/// When transferring the HTML from the source text to the translated target
/// text, the TagStacks are first associated with each of the subwords from the
/// source text. Using hard alignment, each subword in the source text is linked
/// to a subword in the target text. The TagStacks are then copied over these
/// links. Finally, the HTML is inserted back into the target text by for each
/// subword, comparing the TagStack from the previous word to that word, and
/// opening and closing elements to make up for the difference.
///
/// There are a couple of complexities though:
/// 1. Not all tags can be treated as markup applied to text. For example, an
///    `<img>` does not contain text itself. Or `<i></i>` does not. We do want
///    those tags to remain in the output though. We do this by associating
///    them to an empty `Span`. When inserting HTML back into the translation
///    input or output, we keep track of where in the `spans_` vector we are,
///    and insert any elements from empty spans that we might have skipped over
///    because empty spans are never linked to tokens/subwords. These are
///    *stragglers* in some parts of the code, or *void* or *empty* elements in
///    other parts.
/// 2. Some tags should be treated as paragraph indicators, and break up
///    sentences. These are the usual suspects like `<p>`, but also `<li>` and
///    `<td>`, to make sure we don't translate two table cells into a single
///    word. This is the `addSentenceBreak` flag in the HTML parsing bit.
///    We mark these breaks with `\n\n` in the input text and with a special
///    WHITESPACE tag that we treat as any other void tag. Hopefully this tag
///    moves with the added `\n\n` and it is easy for us to remove it again.
///    (in practise it is since these only occur at the end of sentences and
///    the end of sentences are always aligned between source and target.)
/// 3. We treat most tags as word-breaking. We do this by adding spaces just
///    after where we saw the open or close tag occur. If there is already
///    some whitespace in that place, we do not add extra spaces.
/// 4. TODO
