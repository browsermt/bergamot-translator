/// storage which is written onto (copied) from objects we require later on from marian::History
///
/// This class operates with a pointer to the start, templated by type - with which we can provide a "view" onto the
/// flat sequential binary backend, for a convenient API for the rest of the code resembling the true underlying type.
///
/// This class provides read-only APIs and the following convention is baked into code for the layout. A Range is
/// stored as:
///     [n, v0, v1, ... v_{n-1}]
/// where n = number of elements, and v_{i} is the i-th element.
///
/// This is almost a 'static' std::span (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span), but we're not at C++20 yet.
