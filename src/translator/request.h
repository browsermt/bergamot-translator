// Request: holds the input blob of a text, Segments (vector<Words>) which are

// segments and the input blob (sourceTokenRanges). In addition, Request takes
// care of the barrier which fires when all the Segments in a request are done
// translating by the workers (BatchTranslator).
// TODO(jerinphilip):  Extend Request with notions of Priority (sequence,
// user-given).
//
// RequestSentence: is a tuple of (index, Ptr<Request>). This provides the
// batching mechanism access to the segment within the request. The backref to
// Request allows event triggering the barrier upon completion of the last
// sentence by a worker.
