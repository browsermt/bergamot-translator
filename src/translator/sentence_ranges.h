/// An Annotation is a collection of ByteRanges used to denote ancillary
/// information of sentences and words on a text of string. Annotation is meant
/// for consumption on platforms where `string_view` creates problems (eg:
/// exports through WASM) conveniently rebasing them as required into
/// ByteRanges. See AnnotatedText for cases where this is a non-issue.
///
/// **Usage**
///
/// To ensure rebasing is consistent during creation and updation, use
/// `Annotation` best through `AnnotatedText`, which also holds the reference
/// string and can work with `string_views`.
///
/// If used separately, it is on the user to ensure the reference string
/// is the same as what the Annotation refers to. For best results, an instance
/// is expected to be read only in this mode of operation.
///
/// **Idea**
///
/// Annotation is intended to be the same structure conceptually as below,
/// except the `std::vector<std::vector<ByteRange>>` hammered into a flat
/// structure to avoid multiple reallocs keeping efficiency in mind. This is
/// achieved by having markers of where sentence ends in the flat container
/// storing word ByteRanges.
///
/// ```cpp
/// typedef ByteRange Word;
/// // std::vector<ByteRange>, a single sentence
/// typedef std::vector<Word> Sentence;
/// std::vector<std::vector<ByteRange> // multiple sentences
/// typedef std::vector<Sentence> Annotation;
///
/// Annotation example;
/// ```
/// This structure exists to provide a consistent API to access the nested
/// sentences of varying lengths, which occur in source-text processed into
/// multiple sentences, and target-text translated from source as multiple
/// sentences, both composed of (sub)-words, providing a List[List] like access
/// while storing it in a compact and efficient manner.
