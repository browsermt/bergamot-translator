/// Service offers  an asynchronous translation service. This is intended to be
/// similar to the ones provided for training or decoding in ML pipelines with
/// the following additional capabilities: 
///
///  1. Provision of a request -> response based translation flow unlike the
///  usual a line based translation or decoding provided in most ML frameworks.
///  2. Internal handling of normalization etc which changes source text to
///  provide to client translation meta-information like alignments consistent
///  with the unnormalized input text.
///
/// Service exposes methods to instantiate the service from a string configuration
/// (which can cover most translators) and to translate an incoming blob of text.
///
///
/// An example use of this API looks as follows:
/// ```cpp
///  options = ...;
///  service = Service(options);
///  std::string input_text = "Hello World";
///  std::future<Response>
///      responseFuture = service.translate(std::move(input_text));
///  responseFuture.wait(); // Wait until translation has completed.
///  Response response(std::move(response.get());
///  
/// // Do things with response.
/// ```
///
/// Optionally Service can be initialized by also passing model_memory for
/// purposes of efficiency (which defaults to nullpointer and then reads from
/// file supplied through config).
