/// Service offers methods create an asynchronous translation service that
/// translates a plain (without any markups and emojis)  UTF-8 encoded text.
/// This implementation supports translation from 1 source language to 1 target
/// language.
///
///  This is intended to be similar to the ones  provided for training or
///  decoding in ML pipelines with the following  additional capabilities:
///
///  1. Provision of a request -> response based translation flow unlike the
///  usual a line based translation or decoding provided in most ML frameworks.
///  2. Internal handling of normalization etc which changes source text to
///  provide to client translation meta-information like alignments consistent
///  with the unnormalized input text.
///  3. The API splits each text entry into sentences internally, which are then
///  translated independent of each other. The translated sentences are then
///  joined back together and returned in Response.
///
/// Service exposes methods to instantiate the service from a string
/// configuration (which can cover most translators) and to translate an
/// incoming blob of text.
///
///
/// An example use of this API looks as follows:
/// ```cpp
///  options = ...;
///  service = Service(options);
///  std::string input_text = "Hello World";
///  std::future<Response>
///      responseFuture = service.translate(std::move(input_text));
///  responseFuture.wait(); // Wait until translation has completed.
///  Response response(std::move(response.get());
///
/// // Do things with response.
/// ```
///
/// Optionally Service can be initialized by also passing bytearray memories
/// for purposes of efficiency (which defaults to empty and then reads from
/// file supplied through config).
///
